# Hair Removal in Dermoscopic Images with Soft Color Morphology

Algorithm to remove hair in dermoscopic images, based on the top hat operation with a bank of oriented bar-like structuring elements.
Inpainting achieved by iteratively recovering missing colors with two morphological operations: opening and closing.

## Getting Started

You may download from the repository, or just install through pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/pbibiloni/hair-removal.git
```

To use:
```
from hair_removal import remove_and_inpaint

remove_and_inpaint(dermoscopic_image_as_rgb)
```

It can be customized:
```
from hair_removal import bank_of_structuring_elements, remove_and_inpaint

tophats_se = bank_of_structuring_elements(side_enclosing_square_in_px=9, num_orientations=3)
inpainting_se = np.ones((3, 3), dtype='float32')
remove_and_inpaint(dermoscopic_image_as_rgb, tophats_se=tophats_se, inpainting_se=inpainting_se)
```
