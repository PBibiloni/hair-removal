# Hair Removal in Dermoscopic Images with Soft Color Morphology

Algorithm to remove hair in dermoscopic images, based on the top hat operation with a bank of oriented bar-like structuring elements.

## Getting Started

Soft color morphology provide two operators, erosion and dilation, that can be combined to form other complex 
mathematical morphology operators. It admits non-binary structuring elements.

Duplicate the :
```bash
pip install softcolor
```

To use in natural images, we recommend using the CIELab color space:
```python
import numpy as np
from skimage import data
from softcolor.morphology import MorphologyInCIELab

morphology = MorphologyInCIELab()
structuring_element = np.ones(shape=(5, 1), dtype='float32')

image = data.astronaut()
image_eroded = morphology.erosion(image, structuring_element)
image_dilated = morphology.dilation(image, structuring_element)
```

The soft color morphology operators depend on a fuzzy conjunction and a fuzzy implication function.
They can be provided as:
```python
from skimage import data
from skimage.morphology import disk
from softcolor.morphology import MorphologyInCIELab, soften_structuring_element
from softcolor.aggregation_functions import conjunction_min, implication_godel

morphology = MorphologyInCIELab(
    conjunction=conjunction_min,
    fuzzy_implication_function=implication_godel)
structuring_element = soften_structuring_element(disk(5))

image = data.astronaut()
image_eroded = morphology.opening(image, structuring_element)
image_dilated = morphology.closing(image, structuring_element)
```

Some operations (e.g. top-hat, inpainting) also depend on a measure of dissimilarity between images (such as the 
pixel-wise Euclidean distance) and a method to combine images (such as the standard average).

To apply the soft color operators with generic color spaces, use the class `softcolor.morphology.BaseMorphology`.
